## Overview

[Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/openshift/) provides a flexible, self-service deployment of fully managed OpenShift clusters. Maintain regulatory compliance and focus on your application development, while your master, infrastructure, and application nodes are patched, updated, and monitored by both Microsoft and Red Hat.

[Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io) is an IBM Open Source project that implements the Eclipse MicroProfile specifications and is also Java/Jakarta EE compatible. Open Liberty is fast to start up with a low memory footprint and supports live reloading for quick iterative development. It is simple to add and remove features from the latest versions of MicroProfile and Java/Jakarta EE. Zero migration lets you focus on what's important, not the APIs changing under you.

[WebSphere Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty) architecture shares the same code base as the open sourced Open Liberty server runtime, which provides additional benefits such as low-cost experimentation, customization and seamless migration from open source to production.

This repository contains samples projects for developing and deploying Java applications with Open/WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster.
These sample projects show how to use various features in Open/WebSphere Liberty and how to integrate with different Azure services.
Below table shows the list of samples available in this repository.
