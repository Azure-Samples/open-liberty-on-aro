# Deploy a Java application with Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster

This guide demonstrates how to run your [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/), or [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/) application on the Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty runtime and then deploy the containerized application to an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) 4 cluster using the Open Liberty Operator. This article will walk you through preparing a Liberty application, building the application Docker image and running the containerized application on an ARO 4 cluster.  The foundational elements of technology in this article include the following:

* [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io): Open Liberty is an IBM Open Source project that implements the Eclipse MicroProfile specifications and is also Jakarta EE compatible. Open Liberty is fast to start up with a low memory footprint and supports live reloading for quick iterative development. It is simple to add and remove features from the latest versions of MicroProfile and Jakarta EE. Zero migration lets you focus on what's important, not the APIs changing under you.
* [WebSphere Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty): IBM WebSphere Liberty architecture shares the same code base as the open sourced Open Liberty server runtime, which provides additional benefits such as low-cost experimentation, customization and seamless migration from open source to production.
* [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/openshift/): Azure Red Hat OpenShift provides flexible, self-service deployment of fully managed OpenShift clusters. Maintain regulatory compliance and focus on your application development, while your master, infrastructure, and application nodes are patched, updated, and monitored by both Microsoft and Red Hat.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following prerequisites to successfully walk through this guide.

<!-- IMPORTANT: find a way to capture this activation action to count against our OKRs.  DO NOT PUBLISH without this. -->
1. [Register an Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go/).
   > [!NOTE]
   > Azure Red Hat OpenShift requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. The default Azure resource quota for a new Azure subscription does not meet this requirement. To request an increase in your resource limit, see [Standard quota: Increase limits by VM series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests). Note that the free trial subscription isn't eligible for a quota increase, [upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription) before requesting a quota increase.
2. Prepare a local machine with Unix-like operating system installed (for example, Ubuntu, macOS).
3. Install a Java SE implementation, version 17 or later (for example, [Eclipse Open J9](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/)).
4. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3.5.0 or higher.
5. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your OS.
6. Install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true) 2.0.75 or later.
7. Check and install [`envsubst`](https://command-not-found.com/envsubst) if it's not pre-installed in your operating system.
8. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aro) to your local file system.

### Set up Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster

Follow the instructions in these two tutorials and then return here to continue.

1. Create the cluster by following the steps in [Create an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/openshift/tutorial-create-cluster).
   > [!NOTE]
   > Though the "Get a Red Hat pull secret" step is labeled as optional, **it is required for this article**.  The pull secret enables your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster to find the Open Liberty Operator.
   >
   > If you plan to run memory-intensive applications on the cluster, specify the proper virtual machine size for the worker nodes using the `--worker-vm-size` parameter. For example, `Standard_E4s_v3` is the minimum virtual machine size to install the Elasticsearch Operator on a cluster. Refer to the following for further details:
   >
   > * [Azure CLI to create a cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/aro?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true#az-aro-create)
   > * [Supported virtual machine sizes for memory optimized](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/openshift/support-policies-v4#memory-optimized)
   > * [Prerequisites to install the Elasticsearch Operator](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html#cluster-logging-deploy-eo-cli_cluster-logging-deploying)

2. Connect to the cluster by following the steps in [Connect to an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/openshift/tutorial-connect-cluster).
   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > * Be sure to follow the steps in "Install the OpenShift CLI" because we will use the `oc` command later in this article.
   > * Write down the cluster console URL which looks like `https://console-openshift-console.apps.<random>.<region>.aroapp.io/`.
   > * Write down the `kubeadmin` credentials.
   > * Be sure to follow the steps in "Connect using the OpenShift CLI" with the `kubeadmin` credentials.

### Install the Open Liberty OpenShift Operator

After creating and connecting to the cluster, install the [Open Liberty Operator](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator) by following the steps in [Install the Open Liberty OpenShift Operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/ee/liberty-on-aro?tabs=without-mysql-dev%2Cwithout-mysql-mage%2Cwithout-mysql-deploy-cli#install-the-open-liberty-openshift-operator), then return here to continue.

### Create an OpenShift namespace for the Java app

Now create an OpenShift namespace `open-liberty-demo` by following the steps in [Create an OpenShift namespace for the Java app](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/ee/liberty-on-aro?tabs=without-mysql-dev%2Cwithout-mysql-mage%2Cwithout-mysql-deploy-cli#create-an-openshift-namespace-for-the-java-app), then return here to continue.

### Sample application

Within the git repo you cloned in the Prerequisites section, change directory to `1-start`. The sample application uses Maven at build time and only Jakarta EE 10 APIs (Jakarta REST, EJB, CDI, JSON-B, Faces, Bean Validation) at runtime. This standard Jakarta EE app will be used as a starting point to demonstrate the ease of migration to the Liberty runtime. Here is the project structure:

```Text
├── pom.xml                                         # Maven POM file
└── src
    └── main

            └── index.xhtml                         # Home page for JSF client
```

### Run the application on Open Liberty

To run the application on Open Liberty, you need to create an Open Liberty server configuration file so that the [Liberty Maven plugin](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven#liberty-maven-plugin) can package the application for deployment. The Liberty Maven plugin is not required to deploy the application to OpenShift but we will use it in this example with Open Liberty’s developer (dev) mode to easily run the application locally. Complete the following steps on your local computer:

1. Copy `2-simple/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` to `1-start/src/main/liberty/config`, overwriting the existing zero-length file. This `server.xml` configures the Open Liberty server with Jakarta EE features.
2. Replace `1-start/pom.xml` with `2-simple/pom.xml` to add the `liberty-maven-plugin` to the pom.
3. Change directory to `1-start` of your local clone.
4. Run `mvn clean package` in a console to generate a war package `javaee-cafe.war` in the directory `./target`.
5. Run `mvn liberty:dev` to start Open Liberty in dev mode.
6. Wait until the server starts. You’ll see the following output in your console:

   ```Text
   [INFO] Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 7777
   [INFO] Launching defaultServer (Open Liberty 20.0.0.6/wlp-1.0.41.cl200620200528-0414) on Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, version 1.8.0_251-b08 (en_US)

   [INFO] Press the Enter key to run tests on demand. To stop the server and quit dev mode, use Ctrl-C or type 'q' and press the Enter key.
   [INFO] Source compilation was successful.
   ```

7. Open [http://localhost:9080/](http://localhost:9080/) in your browser to visit the application home page. The application will look similar to the following:

   ![JavaEE Cafe Web UI](./media/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app/javaee-cafe-web-ui.png)
8. Press **Control-C** to stop the application and Open Liberty server.

The directory `2-simple` of your local clone shows the Maven project with the above changes already applied.

## Prepare the application image

To deploy and run your Liberty application on an ARO 4 cluster, containerize your application as a Docker image using [Open Liberty container images](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker) or [WebSphere Liberty container images](https://github.com/WASdev/ci.docker).

### Build and run the application locally with Docker

Before deploying the containerized application to a remote cluster, build and run with your local Docker to verify whether it works:

1. Change directory to `2-simple` of your local clone.
1. Run `mvn clean package` to package the application.
1. Run one of the following commands to build the application image.
   * Build with Open Liberty base image:

     ```bash
     # Build and tag application image. This will cause Docker to pull the necessary Open Liberty base images.
     docker build -t javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0 --pull .
     ```

   * Build with WebSphere Liberty base image:

     ```bash
     # Build and tag application image. This will cause Docker to pull the necessary WebSphere Liberty base images.
     docker build -t javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0 --pull --file=Dockerfile-wlp .
     ```

1. Run `docker run -it --rm -p 9080:9080 javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0` in your console.
1. Wait for Liberty server to start and the application to deploy successfully.
1. Open [http://localhost:9080/](http://localhost:9080/) in your browser to visit the application home page.
1. Press **Control-C** to stop the application and Liberty server.

### Build the application and push to the image stream

When you're satisfied with the state of the application, you're going to build the image remotely on the cluster by executing the following commands.

1. Make sure you have already signed in to the OpenShift CLI using the `kubeadmin` credentials.
1. Identity the source directory and the Dockerfile.

   ```bash
   cd <path-to-your-repo>/open-liberty-on-aro/2-simple

   # If you are building with Open Liberty base image, the existing Dockerfile is ready for you

   # If you are building with WebSphere Liberty base image, uncomment and execute the following two commands to rename Dockerfile-wlp to Dockerfile
   # mv Dockerfile Dockerfile.backup
   # mv Dockerfile-wlp Dockerfile
   ```

1. Change project to `open-liberty-demo`.

   ```bash
   oc project open-liberty-demo
   ```

1. Create an image stream.

   ```bash
   oc create imagestream javaee-cafe-simple
   ```

1. Create a build configuration that specifies the image stream tag of the build output.

   ```bash
   oc new-build --name javaee-cafe-simple-config --binary --strategy docker --to javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0
   ```

1. Start the build to upload local contents, containerize, and output to the image stream tag specified before.

   ```bash
   oc start-build javaee-cafe-simple-config --from-dir . --follow
   ```

## Deploy application on the ARO 4 cluster

Now you can deploy the sample Liberty application to the Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster [you created earlier in the article](#set-up-azure-red-hat-openshift-cluster).

### Deploy the application from GUI

Because we use the Open Liberty Operator to manage Liberty applications, we need to create an instance of its *Custom Resource Definition*, of type "OpenLibertyApplication". The Operator will then take care of all aspects of managing the OpenShift resources required for deployment.

1. Log in to the OpenShift web console from your browser using the credentials of the Azure AD user.
2. Expand **Home**, Select **Projects** > **open-liberty-demo**.
3. Navigate to **Operators** > **Installed Operators** > **Open Liberty Operator** > **Open Liberty Application**.  The navigation of items in the user interface mirrors the actual containment hierarchy of technologies in use.

   ![ARO Java Containment](./media/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app/aro-java-containment.png)
4. Select **Create OpenLibertyApplication**
5. Replace the generated yaml with yours, which is located at `<path-to-repo>/2-simple/openlibertyapplication.yaml`.
6. Select **Create**.
7. You'll be returned to the list of OpenLibertyApplications.  Select **javaee-cafe-simple** > **Resources** > **javaee-cafe-simple (Route)** and select the link below **Location**.

You'll see the application home page opened in the browser.

### Deploy the application from CLI

Instead of using the web console GUI, you can deploy the application from the command-line. If you have not already done so, download and install the `oc` command-line tool by following Red Hat documentation [Getting Started with the CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html).

1. Log in to the OpenShift web console from your browser using the credentials of the Azure AD user.
2. [Log in to the OpenShift CLI with the token for the Azure AD user](#log-in-to-the-openshift-cli-with-the-token).
3. Change directory to `2-simple` of your local clone, and run the following commands to deploy your Liberty application to the ARO 4 cluster.

   ```bash
   # Switch to namespace "open-liberty-demo" where resources of demo app will belong to
   oc project open-liberty-demo

   Now using project "open-liberty-demo" on server "https://api.aqlm62xm.rnfghf.aroapp.io:6443".

   # Create OpenLibertyApplication "javaee-cafe-simple"
   oc create -f openlibertyapplication.yaml

   openlibertyapplication.openliberty.io/javaee-cafe-simple created

   # Check if OpenLibertyApplication instance is created
   oc get openlibertyapplication javaee-cafe-simple

   NAME                 IMAGE                      EXPOSED   RECONCILED   AGE
   javaee-cafe-simple   javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0   true      True         36s

   # Check if deployment created by Operator is ready
   oc get deployment javaee-cafe-simple

   NAME                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   javaee-cafe-simple   1/1     1            0           102s
   ```

4. Check to see `1/1` under the `READY` column before you continue.  If not, investigate and resolve the problem before continuing.
5. Discover the host of route to the application with the `oc get route` command, as shown here.

   ```bash
   # Get host of the route
   HOST=$(oc get route javaee-cafe-simple --template='{{ .spec.host }}')
   echo "Route Host: $HOST"

   Route Host: javaee-cafe-simple-open-liberty-demo.apps.aqlm62xm.rnfghf.aroapp.io
   ```

   Once the Liberty application is up and running, open the output of **Route Host** in your browser to visit the application home page.
