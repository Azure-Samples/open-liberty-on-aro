# Integrate your Open Liberty application with different Azure services

In this guide, you will integrate your Open Liberty application with different Azure services, including security, data persistence & distributed logging. The Open Liberty application is running on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) 4 cluster. You learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up different services
> * Prepare your application
> * Prepare application image
> * Deploy sample application

## Before you begin

In previous guides, a Java application, which is running inside Open Liberty runtime, is deployed to an ARO 4 cluster. If you have not done these guides, walk them through with the following links and return here to continue.

* [Deploy a Java application inside Open Liberty on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster](howto-deploy-java-openliberty-app.md)
* [Integrate your Open Liberty application with Azure Active Directory OpenID Connect](howto-integrate-aad-oidc.md)
* [Integrate your Open Liberty application with Azure managed databases](howto-integrate-azure-managed-databases.md)
* [Integrate your Open Liberty application with Elasticsearch stack](howto-integrate-elasticsearch-stack.md)

## Set up different services

When you complete all of previous guides, different services used for this guide have already set up. Let's recap them one by one.

1. [Set up Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster](howto-deploy-java-openliberty-app.md#set-up-azure-red-hat-openshift-cluster).
2. [Set up Azure Active Directory](howto-integrate-aad-oidc.md#set-up-azure-active-directory).
3. [Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server](howto-integrate-azure-managed-databases.md#create-an-azure-database-for-postgresql-server).
4. [Deploy cluster logging](howto-integrate-elasticsearch-stack.md#deploy-cluster-logging).

## Prepare your application

The application `<path-to-repo>/2-simple` used in the previous [basic guide](howto-deploy-java-openliberty-app.md) hasn't enabled security, data persistence or distributed logging. To make it integrate with different services, a number of files need to be updated or created:

| File Name             | Source Path                     | Destination Path              | Operation  | Description           |

For reference, these changes have already been applied in `<path-to-repo>/4-finish` of your local clone.

Execute the following commands to build application package:

```bash
cd <path-to-repo>/4-finish
mvn clean package
```

## Prepare application image

The `Dockerfile` located at [`<path-to-repo>/4-finish/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aro/blob/master/4-finish/Dockerfile) is almost same as the one used in the previous [basic guide](howto-deploy-java-openliberty-app.md), except the addition of JDBC driver. Follow steps below to build the application image:

1. Change directory to `<path-to-repo>/4-finish` of your local clone.
2. Download [postgresql-42.2.4.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/postgresql/postgresql/42.2.4/postgresql-42.2.4.jar) and put it to current working directory.
3. Run the following commands to build application image and push to your ACR instance.

   ```bash
   # Build and tag application image
   docker build -t javaee-cafe-all-in-one:1.0.0 --pull .

   # Create a new tag with your ACR instance info that refers to source image
   # Note: replace "${Container_Registry_URL}" with the fully qualified name of your ACR instance
   docker tag javaee-cafe-all-in-one:1.0.0 ${Container_Registry_URL}/javaee-cafe-all-in-one:1.0.0

   # Log in to your ACR instance
   # Note: replace "${Registry_Name}" with the name of your ACR instance
   az acr login -n ${Registry_Name}

   # Push image to your ACR instance
   # Note: replace "${Container_Registry_URL}" with the fully qualified name of your ACR instance
   docker push ${Container_Registry_URL}/javaee-cafe-all-in-one:1.0.0
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Replace **${Container_Registry_URL}** with the fully qualified name of your ACR instance.

## Deploy sample application

To integrate the application with Azure AD OpenID Connect and Azure Database for PostgreSQL server on the ARO 4 cluster, a number of Kubernetes resource YAML files need to be updated or created.

| File Name             | Source Path                     | Destination Path              | Operation  | Description           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|  
| `aad-oidc-secret.yaml` | | [`<path-to-repo>/4-finish/aad-oidc-secret.yaml`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aro/blob/master/4-finish/aad-oidc-secret.yaml) | New | A Kubernetes **Secret** resource with user input data, including `client.id`, `client.secret`, `tenant.id`, and `admin.group.id`. |
| `tls-crt-secret.yaml` | | [`<path-to-repo>/4-finish/tls-crt-secret.yaml`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aro/blob/master/4-finish/tls-crt-secret.yaml) | New | A Kubernetes **Secret** resource with user input data, including `ca.crt`, `destCA.crt`, `tls.crt`, and `tls.key`. |
| `db-secret.yaml` | | [`<path-to-repo>/4-finish/db-secret.yaml`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aro/blob/master/4-finish/db-secret.yaml) | New | A Kubernetes **Secret** resource with PostgreSQL database connection data, including `db.server.name`, `db.port.number`, `db.name`, `db.user`, and `db.password`. |
| `openlibertyapplication.yaml` | [`<path-to-repo>/2-simple/openlibertyapplication.yaml`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aro/blob/master/2-simple/openlibertyapplication.yaml) | [`<path-to-repo>/4-finish/openlibertyapplication.yaml`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aro/blob/master/4-finish/openlibertyapplication.yaml) | Updated | Add environment variables whose values are from Secret `aad-oidc-secret` and `db-secret-postgres`. Specify existing certificate for **Route** and **Service** of **OpenLibertyApplication** custom resource. |

For reference, these changes have already been applied in `<path-to-repo>/4-finish` of your local clone.

These resources have already been created in previous guides. Let's recap how we deploy the sample application to the ARO 4 cluster, by executing the following commands.

```bash
# Change directory to "<path-to-repo>/4-finish"
cd <path-to-repo>/4-finish

# Change project to "open-liberty-demo"
oc project open-liberty-demo

# Create environment variables which will be passed to secret "aad-oidc-secret"
# Note: replace "<client ID>", "<client secret>", "<tenant ID>", and "<group ID>" with the ones you noted down before
export CLIENT_ID=<client ID>
export CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret>
export TENANT_ID=<tenant ID>
export ADMIN_GROUP_ID=<group ID>

# Create secret "aad-oidc-secret"
envsubst < aad-oidc-secret.yaml | oc create -f -

# Create TLS private key and certificate, which is also used as CA certificate for testing purpose
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt

# Create environment variables which will be passed to secret "tls-crt-secret"
export CA_CRT=$(cat tls.crt | base64 -w 0)
export DEST_CA_CRT=$(cat tls.crt | base64 -w 0)
export TLS_CRT=$(cat tls.crt | base64 -w 0)
export TLS_KEY=$(cat tls.key | base64 -w 0)

# Create secret "tls-crt-secret"
envsubst < tls-crt-secret.yaml | oc create -f -

# Create environment variables which will be passed to secret "db-secret-postgres"
# Note: replace "<Server name>", "<Port number>", "<Admin username>", and "<Password>" with the ones you noted down before
export DB_SERVER_NAME=<Server name>.postgres.database.azure.com
export DB_PORT_NUMBER=<Port number>
export DB_NAME=postgres
export DB_USER=<Admin username>@<Server name>
export DB_PASSWORD=<Password>

# Create Secret "db-secret-postgres"
envsubst < db-secret.yaml | oc create -f -

# Create environment variables which will be passed to OpenLibertyApplication "javaee-cafe-all-in-one"
# Note: replace "<Container_Registry_URL>" with the fully qualified name of your ACR instance
export Container_Registry_URL=<Container_Registry_URL>

# Create OpenLibertyApplication "javaee-cafe-all-in-one"
envsubst < openlibertyapplication.yaml | oc create -f -

# Check if OpenLibertyApplication instance is created
oc get openlibertyapplication

# Check if deployment created by Operator is ready
oc get deployment

# Check if route is created by Operator
oc get route
```

> [!NOTE]
> * Refer to [Set up Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster](howto-deploy-java-openliberty-app.md#set-up-azure-red-hat-openshift-cluster) on how to connect to the cluster.
> * **open-liberty-demo** is already created in the [previous guide](howto-deploy-java-openliberty-app.md).
> * Replace **\<client ID>**, **\<client secret>**, **\<tenant ID>**, and **\<group ID>** with the ones you noted down before.
> * Replace **\<Server name>**, **\<Port number>**, **\<Admin username>**, and **\<Password>** with the ones you noted down before.
> * Replace **\<Container_Registry_URL>** with the fully qualified name of your ACR instance.

Once the Open Liberty Application is up and running, copy **HOST/PORT** of the route from console output.

1. Open your **Azure AD** > **App registrations** > your **registered application** > **Authentication** > Click **Add URI** in **Redirect URIs** section > Input ***https://<copied_HOST/PORT_value>/ibm/api/social-login/redirect/liberty-aad-oidc-javaeecafe*** > Click **Save**.
2. Open ***https://<copied_HOST/PORT_value>*** in the **InPrivate** window of **Microsoft Edge**, verify the application is secured by Azure AD OpenID Connect and connected to Azure Database for PostgreSQL server.

   1. Sign in as a user, who doesn't belong to the admin group you created before.
   2. Update your password if necessary. Accept permission requested if necessary.
   3. You will see the email address of your AAD account displayed in the application home page, where the coffee **Delete** button is **disabled**.
   4. Create new coffees.
   5. Close the **InPrivate** window > open a new **InPrivate** window > sign in as another user, who does belong to the admin group you created before.
   6. Update your password if necessary. Accept permission requested if necessary.
   7. You will see the email address of your AAD account displayed in the application home page, where the coffee **Delete** button is **enabled** now.
   8. Create new coffees. Delete existing coffees.

The application logs are shipped to the Elasticsearch cluster, and can be visualized in the Kinaba web console.

1. Log into ARO web console. Click **Monitoring** > **Logging**.
2. In the new opened window, click **Log in with OpenShift**. Log in with user **kubeadmin**.
3. Open **Management** > **Index Patterns** > Select **project.\*** > Click **Refresh field list** icon at top-right of the page.
4. Click **Discover**. Select index pattern **project.\*** from the dropdown list.
5. Add **kubernetes.namespace_name**, **kubernetes.pod_name**, **loglevel**, and **message** from **Available Fields** into **Selected Fields**. Discover application logs from the work area of the page.
