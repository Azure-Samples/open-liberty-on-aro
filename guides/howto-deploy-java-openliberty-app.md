# Deploy a Java application with Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster

This guide demonstrates how to run your Java, Java EE, [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/), or [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/) application on the Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty runtime and then deploy the containerized application to an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) 4 cluster using the Open Liberty Operator. This article will walk you through preparing an Liberty application, building the application Docker image and running the containerized application on an ARO 4 cluster.  The foundational elements of technology in this article include the following:

* [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io): Open Liberty is an IBM Open Source project that implements the Eclipse MicroProfile specifications and is also Java/Jakarta EE compatible. Open Liberty is fast to start up with a low memory footprint and supports live reloading for quick iterative development. It is simple to add and remove features from the latest versions of MicroProfile and Java/Jakarta EE. Zero migration lets you focus on what's important, not the APIs changing under you.
* [WebSphere Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-liberty): IBM WebSphere Liberty architecture shares the same code base as the open sourced Open Liberty server runtime, which provides additional benefits such as low-cost experimentation, customization and seamless migration from open source to production.
* [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/openshift/): Azure Red Hat OpenShift provides a flexible, self-service deployment of fully managed OpenShift clusters. Maintain regulatory compliance and focus on your application development, while your master, infrastructure, and application nodes are patched, updated, and monitored by both Microsoft and Red Hat.

## Prerequisites

Complete the following prerequisites to successfully walk through this guide.

<!-- IMPORTANT: find a way to capture this activation action to count against our OKRs.  DO NOT PUBLISH without this. -->
1. Install a Java SE implementation (for example, [AdoptOpenJDK OpenJDK 8 LTS/OpenJ9](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=openj9)).
2. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 3.5.0 or higher.
3. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your OS.
4. Register a [Docker Hub](https://id.docker.com/) account.
5. Install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) 2.0.75 or later.
6. Register an Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can get an [Azure subscription free for one year](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
7. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/open-liberty-on-aro) to your local file system.

## Set up Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster

Follow the instructions in these two tutorials and then return here to continue.

1. Create the cluster by following the steps in [Create an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster](/azure/openshift/tutorial-create-cluster).  
   > [!NOTE]
   > Though the "Get a Red Hat pull secret" step is labeled as optional, **it is required for this article**.  The pull secret enables your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster to find the Open Liberty Operator.
   >
   > If you plan to run memory-intensive applications on the cluster, specify the proper virtual machine size for the worker nodes using the `--worker-vm-size` parameter. For example, `Standard_E4s_v3` is the minimum virtual machine size to install the Elasticsearch Operator on a cluster. Refer to the following for further details:
   > * [Azure CLI to create a cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/aro?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aro-create)
   > * [Supported virtual machine sizes for memory optimized](/azure/openshift/support-policies-v4#memory-optimized)
   > * [Prerequisites to install the Elasticsearch Operator](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html#cluster-logging-deploy-eo-cli_cluster-logging-deploying)

2. Connect to the cluster by following the steps in [Connect to an Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster](/azure/openshift/tutorial-connect-cluster).  Be sure to follow the steps in "Install the OpenShift CLI" because we will use the `oc` command later in this article.

## Install the Open Liberty OpenShift Operator

After creating and connecting to the cluster, install the [Open Liberty Operator](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator).

1. Log in to the OpenShift web console from your browser.
2. Navigate to **Operators** > **OperatorHub** and search for **Open Liberty Operator**.
3. Select **Open Liberty Operator** from the search results.
4. Select **Install**.
5. In the popup **Create Operator Subscription**, check **All namespaces on the cluster (default)** for **Installation Mode**, **beta** for **Update Channel**, and **Automatic** for **Approval Strategy**:
   ![install-operator](./media/howto-deploy-java-openliberty-app/install-operator.png)
6. Select **Subscribe** and wait a minute or two until the Open Liberty Operator is displayed.
7. Observe the Open Liberty Operator with status of "Succeeded".  If you do not, trouble shoot and resolve the problem before continuing.

## Prepare the Liberty application

We will use a Java EE 8 application as our example in this guide. Open Liberty is a [Java EE 8 full profile](https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/) compatible server, so it can easily run the application.  Open Liberty is also [Jakarta EE 8 full profile compatible](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/8/apidocs/).  If you already have a Java EE, Jakarta EE or MicroProfile application running on an existing server (for example, IBM WebSphere Application Server, Oracle WebLogic Server, WildFly, JBoss EAP, and so on), only minimal changes should be necessary to make the application run on Liberty runtime.

### Sample application

Within the git repo you cloned in the Prerequisites section, change directory to `1-start`. The sample application uses Maven at build time and only Java EE 8 APIs (JAX-RS, EJB, CDI, JSON-B, JSF, Bean Validation) at runtime. This standard Java EE app will be used as a starting point to demonstrate the ease of migration to Liberty runtime. Here is the project structure:

```Text
├── pom.xml                                         # Maven POM file
└── src
    └── main

            └── index.xhtml                         # Home page for JSF client
```

### Run the application on Open Liberty

To run the application on Open Liberty, you need to create an Open Liberty server configuration file so that the [Liberty Maven plugin](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven#liberty-maven-plugin) can package the application for deployment. The Liberty Maven plugin is not required to deploy the application to OpenShift but we will use it in this example with Open Liberty’s developer (dev) mode to easily run the application locally. Complete the following steps on your local computer:

1. Copy `2-simple/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` to `1-start/src/main/liberty/config`, overwriting the existing zero-length file. This `server.xml` configures the Open Liberty server with Java EE features.
2. Replace `1-start/pom.xml` with `2-simple/pom.xml` to add the `liberty-maven-plugin` to the pom.
3. Change directory to `1-start` of your local clone.
4. Run `mvn clean package` in a console to generate a war package `javaee-cafe.war` in the directory `./target`.
5. Run `mvn liberty:dev` to start Open Liberty in dev mode.
6. Wait until the server starts. You’ll see the following output in your console:

   ```Text
   [INFO] Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 7777
   [INFO] Launching defaultServer (Open Liberty 20.0.0.6/wlp-1.0.41.cl200620200528-0414) on Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM, version 1.8.0_251-b08 (en_US)

   [INFO] Press the Enter key to run tests on demand. To stop the server and quit dev mode, use Ctrl-C or type 'q' and press the Enter key.
   [INFO] Source compilation was successful.
   ```

7. Open [http://localhost:9080/](http://localhost:9080/) in your browser to visit the application home page. The application will look similar to the following:
   ![javaee-cafe-web-ui](./media/howto-deploy-java-openliberty-app/javaee-cafe-web-ui.png)
8. Press **Control-C** to stop the application and Open Liberty server. 

The directory `2-simple` of your local clone shows the Maven project with the above changes already applied.

## Deploy application on ARO 4 cluster

To deploy and run your Liberty application on an ARO 4 cluster, containerize your application as a Docker image using [Open Liberty container images](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker) or [WebSphere Liberty container images](https://github.com/WASdev/ci.docker).

### Build application image

Complete the following steps to build the application image: 

1. Change directory to `2-simple` of your local clone.
2. Run `mvn clean package` to package the application.
3. Run one of the following commands to build the application image.
   * Build with Open Liberty base image:
     ```bash
     # Build and tag application image. This will cause Docker to pull the necessary Open Liberty base images.
     docker build -t javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0 --pull .
     ```
   
   * Build with WebSphere Liberty base image:
     ```bash
     # Build and tag application image. This will cause Docker to pull the necessary WebSphere Liberty base images.
     docker build -t javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0 --pull --file=Dockerfile-wlp .
     ```

### Run the application locally with Docker

Before deploying the containerized application to a remote cluster, run with your local Docker to verify whether it works:

1. Run `docker run -it --rm -p 9080:9080 javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0` in your console.
2. Wait for Liberty server to start and the application to deploy successfully.
3. Open [http://localhost:9080/](http://localhost:9080/) in your browser to visit the application home page.
4. Press **Control-C** to stop the application and Liberty server.

### Push the image to Docker Hub

When you're satisfied with the state of the application, push it to Docker Hub using the following commands:

```bash
# Create a new tag with your Docker Hub account info that refers to source image
# Note: replace "${Your_DockerHub_Account}" with your valid Docker Hub account name
docker tag javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0 docker.io/${Your_DockerHub_Account}/javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0

# Log in to Docker Hub
docker login

# Push image to your Docker Hub repositories
# Note: replace "${Your_DockerHub_Account}" with your valid Docker Hub account name
docker push docker.io/${Your_DockerHub_Account}/javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0
```

### Prepare OpenLibertyApplication yaml file

Because we use the Open Liberty Operator to manage Liberty applications, we need to create an instance of its *Custom Resource Definition*, of type "OpenLibertyApplication". The Operator will then take care of all aspects of managing the OpenShift resources required for deployment.

1. Open the following resource definition file, which is located at `<path-to-repo>/2-simple/openlibertyapplication.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
   kind: OpenLibertyApplication
   metadata:
     name: javaee-cafe-simple
     namespace: open-liberty-demo
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     # Note: replace "${Your_DockerHub_Account}" with your valid Docker Hub account name
     applicationImage: docker.io/${Your_DockerHub_Account}/javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0
     expose: true
   ```

2. Edit the file by replacing **${Your_DockerHub_Account}** with your valid Docker Hub account name.

Now you can deploy the sample Liberty application to the Azure Red Hat OpenShift 4 cluster [you created earlier in the article](#set-up-azure-red-hat-openshift-cluster).

### Deploy from GUI

1. Log in to the OpenShift web console from your browser.
2. Navigate to **Administration** > **Namespaces** > **Create Namespace**.
3. Fill in "open-liberty-demo" for **Name** and select **Create**, as shown next.
   ![create-namespace](./media/howto-deploy-java-openliberty-app/create-namespace.png)
4. Navigate to **Operators** > **Installed Operators** > **Open Liberty Operator** > **Open Liberty Application**.  The navigation of items in the user interface mirrors the actual containment hierarchy of technologies in use.
   ![ARO Java Containment](./media/howto-deploy-java-openliberty-app/aro-java-containment.png)
5. Select **Create OpenLibertyApplication**
6. Replace the generated yaml with yours.  The final yaml should look like the following.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: openliberty.io/v1beta1
    kind: OpenLibertyApplication
    metadata:
      name: javaee-cafe-simple
      namespace: open-liberty-demo
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      # Note: replace "${Your_DockerHub_Account}" with your valid Docker Hub account name
      applicationImage: docker.io/${Your_DockerHub_Account}/javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0
      expose: true
    ```

7. Select **Create**.
8. You'll be returned to the list of OpenLibertyApplications.  Select **javaee-cafe-simple** > **Resources** > **javaee-cafe-simple (Route)** and click the link below **Location**.

You'll see the application home page opened in the browser.

### Deploy from CLI

Instead of using the web console GUI, you can deploy the application from the command-line. If you have not already done so, download and install the `oc` command-line tool by following Red Hat documentation [Getting Started with the CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html).  To use CLI deployment, you'll need to log in to the OpenShift cluster web console and retrieve a token:

1. At the right-top of the web console, expand the context menu of the logged-in user (`kube:admin` for example), then click "Copy Login Command".
2. Log in to a new tab window if necessary.
3. Select "Display Token".
4. Copy the value listed below "Log in with this token" to the clipboard and run it in a shell, as shown here.

   ```bash
   oc login --token=XOdASlzeT7BHT0JZW6Fd4dl5EwHpeBlN27TAdWHseob --server=https://api.aqlm62xm.rnfghf.aroapp.io:6443
   Logged into "https://api.aqlm62xm.rnfghf.aroapp.io:6443" as "kube:admin" using the token provided.

   You have access to 57 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

   Using project "default".
   ```

5. Change directory to `2-simple` of your local clone, and run the following commands to deploy your Liberty application to the ARO 4 cluster.

   ```bash
   # Create new namespace where resources of demo app will belong to
   oc new-project open-liberty-demo

   Now using project "open-liberty-demo" on server "https://api.aqlm62xm.rnfghf.aroapp.io:6443".

   # Create an ENV variable which will substitute the one defined in openlibertyapplication.yaml
   # Note: replace "<Your_DockerHub_Account>" with your valid Docker Hub account name
   export Your_DockerHub_Account=<Your_DockerHub_Account>

   # Substitute "Your_DockerHub_Account" in openlibertyapplication.yaml and then create resource
   envsubst < openlibertyapplication.yaml | oc create -f -

   openlibertyapplication.openliberty.io/javaee-cafe-simple created

   # Check if OpenLibertyApplication instance is created
   oc get openlibertyapplication

   NAME                 IMAGE                                                 EXPOSED   RECONCILED   AGE
   javaee-cafe-simple   docker.io/<docker_account>/javaee-cafe-simple:1.0.0   true      True         36s

   # Check if deployment created by Operator is ready
   oc get deployment

   NAME                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   javaee-cafe-simple   1/1     1            0           102s
   ```

6. Check to see `1/1` under the `READY` column before you continue.  If not, investigate and resolve the problem before continuing.
7. Discover the "route" to the application with the `oc get route` command, as shown here.

   ```bash
   # Check if route is created by Operator
   oc get route

   NAME                 HOST/PORT                                                                PATH   SERVICES             PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
   javaee-cafe-simple   javaee-cafe-simple-open-liberty-demo.apps.aqlm62xm.rnfghf.aroapp.io             javaee-cafe-simple   9080-tcp                 None
   ```

   Once the Liberty application is up and running, open **HOST/PORT** of the route in your browser to visit the application home page.
